Description: rscrublet is a R-version of python scrublet written by Allon Klein Lab (https://github.com/AllonKleinLab/scrublet, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.11.005).
	Original code was directly translated from python to R, I attempted to preserve orignal code structure, function and variable names whenever possible.
	The only difference that rscrublet is written in not OOP paradigm. Rscrublet is not fully tested yet, but at least with default settings it produces results that 
	are exactly equal to results of python version if stochasticity is accounted correctly.
